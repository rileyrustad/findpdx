#Find PDX Rentals

The aim for this project is to leverage local rental data to build a tool to find an apartment/rental. I would like for the tool to allow me to:
1. Look at the entire city to visualize where I can live.
2. Evaluate the pricing of current listings
3. Give recommendations based on a chosen listing or user input search parameters
4. Set alerts when active listings

This is a personal project to help to help me hone my skills in:
1. Machine Learning/Predictive Analytics
2. Test Driven Development
3. Web Development/UX Design
4. Data Visualization
5. API Development
